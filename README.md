# DimCuantifier

This repository contains the code for my final university work, a method to cuantify complexity of a text as a measure of comparison.
This work uses methods described in SemAxis, FrameAxis and Polar frameworks.

It also contains a study case using [BBC News Dataset](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html) and pre-trained word embeddings from [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
